# Semantic Graph Construction and Ranking of extracted keywords
This repository includes the project made for the course CS6109. A graph-based ranking algorithm for keywords and sentence extraction from text is used here. This project is divided into four modules which are as follows :
#### Module 1 - Indexing
- Importing the required open source tools (spacy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib)
- Tokenizing the text
- Sentence Segmentation
- Vizualizing dependencies
#### Module 2 - Keyword Extraction
- Extracting entities (subject - object pairs)
- Extracting relations
#### Module 3 - Graph construction
- Semantic graph for the document/input
#### Module 4 - Ranking
- Ranking using Eigenvector centrality

*Note : The input files are stored as "file_number".txt*
